## Harmony Korine Quote

> "Try to be great.  Try to give extra.  Try to be bold.  Try to invent your own reality. Do what's not been done before. Don't even get started if you're gonna just try to do some mediocre shit, because there's so much of that. Don't do it just to make noise.  There's too much noise. Give me something amazing. Give me something new. Give me something I haven't seen before, in a way I haven't seen it.  Make me feel something.  Find some kind of magic. Go towards something that's inexplicable.  Give it to me.  Give me something that's aggressive and gnarly and chew up the world.  Come at it from some other place.  But just don't give me the same shit over and over again, because I don't want it."   â€” [Harmony Korine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbcY2VX8t4Y&feature=youtu.be&t=174)
